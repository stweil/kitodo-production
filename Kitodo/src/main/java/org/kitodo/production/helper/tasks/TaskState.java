 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@code CRASHED}</dt>
 * <dd>The thread has terminated abnormally. The field “exception” is holding
 * the exception that has occurred.</dd>
 * <dt>{@code FINISHED}</dt>
 * <dd>The thread has finished its work without errors and is available for
 * clean-up.</dd>
 * <dt>{@code NEW}</dt>
 * <dd>The thread has not yet been started.</dd>
 * <dt>{@code STOPPED}</dt>
 * <dd>The thread was stopped by a front end user—resulting in a call to its
 * {@link EmptyTask#interrupt(Behaviour)} method with
 * {@link EmptyTask.Behaviour}.PREPARE_FOR_RESTART— and is able to restart after
 * cloning and replacing it.</dd>
 * <dt>{@code STOPPING}</dt>
 * <dd>The thread has received a request to interrupt but didn’t stop yet.</dd>
 * <dt>{@code WORKING}</dt>
 * <dd>The thread is in operation.</dd>
