/**
 * A replacement for the variable replacer, which simply replaces the process
 * title.
 *
 * <p>
 * The variable replacer fetches the process data directory from the process
 * service. If the latter does not find a process base URI in the process object
 * in the JUnit integration test, it would try to determine it via the file
 * service and then would want to store it in the process object in the
 * database. This cannot work in the JUnit integration test and also should not
 * happen because the objects that the test runs on are defined in the test
 * method and do not exist in the database. Therefore, this mocked variable
 * replacer is stored in the use folder by the test method in the JUnit
 * integration test. To make this possible, the variable replacer must be stored
 * in a class field and no local variable can be used.
