-- Make sure we have LOCAL, MAX and THUMBS file groups
--
-- LOCAL file group was existing internally and hard-coded without being
-- visible in the database in the past; MAX and THUMBS are typically already
-- existing, but if not, they will be added here. They are pre-configured as
-- non-linking and non-export, so behaviour wonâ€™t be changed.
--
-- In this example, we use the Linux (and Java default) file separator and the
-- _tif suffix for the source images folder. You may want to adjust these
-- values before migrating your system.
